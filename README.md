# reverse_polish_notation_parswe
This project implements a parser and evaluator for expressions written in **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**, also known as **postfix notation**. 

It uses **custom-built Stack and Queue structures** for managing operators and operands, instead of standard library containers.

Features:
- Basic arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
- Unary negation (`N`)
- Conditional expressions (`IF`)
- Variadic functions: `MIN` and `MAX`
- Converts infix expressions to RPN using a stack-based algorithm
- Evaluates the resulting RPN expressions efficiently
